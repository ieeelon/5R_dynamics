# 5R_dynamics
FK-ANN folder contais solution for Forward Kinematics problem for RRRRR planar robot.
IK-ANN folder contains solution for Inverse Kinematics problem for RRRRR planar robot.

The first screenshot demonstrates MLP implementation for FK problem for 5R, the error is 0.0385 (improved from single ReLU with ~0.4)
The second screenshot is MLP for IK: error reduced from ~0.48 to 0.2145
Third screenshot improved previous result for IK from 0.2145 error to 0.1619.
